	# Normally, prerotate and postrotate scripts are run for each log which is rotated and the absolute path to the log
	# file is passed as first argument to the script. That means a single script may be run multiple times for log file
	# entries which match multiple files (such as the /var/log/news/* example). If sharedscripts is specified, the
	# scripts are only run once, no matter how many logs match the wildcarded pattern, and whole pattern is passed to
	# them. However, if none of the logs in the pattern require rotating, the scripts will not be run at all. If the
	# scripts exit with error, the remaining actions will not be executed for any logs. This option overrides the
	# nosharedscripts option and implies create option.
    sharedscripts

    # Immediately after rotation (before the postrotate script is run) the log file is created (with the same name as
    # the log file just rotated). mode specifies the mode for the log file in octal (the same as chmod(2)), owner
    # specifies the user name who will own the log file, and group specifies the group the log file will belong to. Any
    # of the log file attributes may be omitted, in which case those attributes for the new file will use the same
    # values as the original log file for the omitted attributes. This option can be disabled using the nocreate option.
